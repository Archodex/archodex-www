The Archodex Dashboard makes it easy to get the information you need to get on with your tasks. For example, the
[Secrets](./secrets) view makes it easy to see which workloads will be impacted if you rotate a secret. The
[Apps](./apps) view makes it easy to understand the architecture of an application ahead of a refactoring project. And
the [Environments](./environments) view makes it easy to find single-point-of-failure resources that are shared across
environments.
