Archodex is a Platform Engineering Observability solution to help teams safely and quickly perform tasks like rotate
secrets or refactor services. Operational intelligence is gathered by Archodex Agents observing application workloads
running in your platform environments. Insights and information are presented in an intuitive dashboard to help every
member of engineering teams accomplish their tasks more quickly and safely while meeting organizational goals for
security, operations, and compliance.

Archodex provides easily-installed agents and a hosted service, making it easy to get started in minutes. The service
can also be self-hosted, including in on-prem environments, in order to meet any organizational or compliance
requirements.
