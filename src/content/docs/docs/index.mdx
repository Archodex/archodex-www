Archodex is a Platform Engineering Observability solution to help teams safely and quickly perform tasks like rotate
secrets or refactor services. Operational intelligence is gathered by Archodex Agents observing application workloads
running in your platform environments. Insights and information are presented in an intuitive dashboard to help every
member of engineering teams accomplish their tasks more quickly and safely while meeting organizational goals for
security, operations, and compliance.

Unlike other solutions, Archodex Agents have the unique ability to safely observe encrypted service interactions. This
enables Archodex to understand how applications interact with services in order to provide deep operational
intelligence, like where API keys live and which workloads are using them.

Archodex provides easily-installed agents and a hosted service, making it easy to get started in minutes. The service
can also be self-hosted, including in on-prem environments, in order to meet any organizational or compliance
requirements. The Archodex Agent can even be used in logging-only mode, enabling you to test it out and/or send
observations to a destination of your choice.
