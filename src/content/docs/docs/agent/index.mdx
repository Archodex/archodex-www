Archodex provides detailed operational intelligence based on your service interactions that go well beyond existing
observability solutions. The Archodex Agent utilizes [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) to efficiently observe, filter, and record
details of all network traffic. The Agent uses Archodex Rulesets to determine which network traffic to observe and what
data on infrastructure resources and events to pull from the traffic.

<Aside title="What About Data Confidentiality?">
  Your first question before stepping further may be: Where does the Archodex Agent send potentially confidential data it has observed?

**By default the Archodex Agent doesn't send data anywhere.** The Archodex Agent will simply record observations and log
them as output unless you provide a Report API Key. You can even run the agent while firewalled off from network access
to ensure confidential data never leaves your environment.
