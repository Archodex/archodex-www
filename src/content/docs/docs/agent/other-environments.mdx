The Archodex Agent can be used to monitor workloads in any environment where [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) is available.

For example, you might have a workload running on an AWS Autoscaling Group or ECS Cluster of EC2 machines. The Archodex
Agent can be downloaded at startup or baked into machine images and run when the host initializes.

Or maybe you want to kick the tires on your laptop before deploying it out to workloads. You can run the Archodex Agent
as a docker container to monitor workloads running in your local Docker host.

## Running the Archodex Agent as a Binary

The Archodex Agent is a single-file binary that can easily be downloaded and run on any Linux environment with eBPF:

```sh
$ curl -Ls --compressed https://agent.archodex.com/latest > archodex-agent && \
  chmod a+x archodex-agent && \
  ./archodex-agent
```

## Running the Archodex Agent as a Docker Container

The Archodex Agent can be run as a Docker Container to observe activity on the host machine:

```sh
docker run --rm -it --privileged --pid=host public.ecr.aws/archodex/agent:latest
```
