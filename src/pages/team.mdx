ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! We're Chase and Apurva, the two engineers behind Archodex.

We are passionate about building tools that help teams operate their systems safely and with less stress. We are using
our deep skills and experience in building observability, security, and developer experience solutions to solve some of
the most challenging problems in DevSecOps today.

Our goal is to develop and improve Archodex sustainably over the long-term. We are bootstrapping Archodex (meaning we
have not taken outside funding), and are focused first and foremost on building exceptional software :). You won't see
extravagant marketing campaigns from us or attempts to shoe-horn AI where it doesn't belong.

### Chase Douglas

**Principal Engineer / CEO**

Chase is driven to build tools that improve developer experience and team resilience. Before Archodex he was one of the
founders of [Stackery](https://stackery.io), which was acquired by AWS and relaunched as
[AWS Infrastructure Composer](https://aws.amazon.com/infrastructure-composer/). While at AWS he led the Serverless
Developer Experience organization as a Principal Engineer.

Prior to Stackery, Chase was the technical architect of
[New Relic Browser](https://newrelic.com/platform/browser-monitoring), the first client-side solution for web app
observability, used at launch by sites including the New York Times, Apple's Beats Music, and BitBucket. Later he led
engineering at a runtime application security company, IMMUNIO (now part of Trend Micro), that protected Rails apps from
SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Apurva Jantrania

**Principal Engineer / CTO**

Apurva is passionate about making complex systems accessible for developers. Joining Chase as Stackery's first engineer,
he architected novel solutions including a serverless CI/CD platform with ephemeral deployments and automated
infrastructure visualization. Following the AWS acquisition, he led the technical strategy and re:Invent launch of
[AWS Infrastructure Composer](https://aws.amazon.com/infrastructure-composer/).

As a Principal Engineer at AWS, Apurva led development of foundational systems that enable products to deeply understand
customer environments, powering features in [Amazon's AI assistant Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) and
[Amazon CloudWatch's knowledge graph of related resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ExploreRelated.html)
within customer applications. His background spans the full technology stack from low level processor design at Intel to
modern cloud services, giving him a unique perspective for solving complex technical challenges.
