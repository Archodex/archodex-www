We welcome contributions to Archodex!

Most of Archodex is licensed under the [Fair Core License – MIT (FCL‑1.0‑MIT)](https://fcl.dev/)[^LicenseException]. You
can read the [Licensing, Transparency, and Sustainability page](/licensing) for more details about the FCL and why we
chose it for Archodex.

[^LicenseException]:
    The eBPF code under the /src/bpf directory of the [archodex-agent](https://github.com/Archodex/archodex-agent) is
    licensed under the
    [GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

If you want to contribute to Archodex so others may benefit, we need the ability to redistribute your contributions
under the FCL, too. Our Archodex Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) give us permission to do this. Our CLAs are based
on the [Project Harmony CLAs](https://www.harmonyagreements.org/) that were originally drafted by open source project
maintainers to solve the same issue and are common among Open Source / Fair Source software projects.

There are two versions depending on whether you are an individual contributor or a corporate ("entity") contributor:

**[Individual Contributor License Agreement](cla/individual)**

**[Entity Contributor License Agreement](cla/entity)**

When you open a pull request to an Archodex repository for the first time you will be asked to agree to one of these
CLAs. Acceptance of the agreement is recorded when you reply in the pull request.
