title: Licensing, Transparency, and Sustainability
description: Archodex Licensing and Fair Source
layout: ~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro
---

We're building Archodex because we love helping people improve the resilience of their systems and simplify work for
teams that operate them. We further aim to do so for as many people as we can over a long time horizon. Along the way,
we plan to be as transparent and open as possible.

To do this sustainably as a small team, we’ve adopted a licensing strategy that balances three goals:

- **Impact** — by making Archodex available to as many people as possible, especially individuals and small teams for
  free
- **Transparency** — by publishing our code for inspection, self‑hosting, and sharing of knowledge
- **Sustainability** — by ensuring we can continue improving Archodex with a reasonable revenue stream in both the short
  and long term

Archodex software is released under the **[Fair Core License – MIT (FCL‑1.0‑MIT)](https://fcl.dev/)**[^BPFException] to
meet these goals. We are a [small team](/team) trying to strike a fair balance between freedom and sustainability, and
we aim to earn your trust by being transparent from the start.

[^BPFException]:
    The eBPF code under the `/src/bpf` directory of the [archodex-agent](https://github.com/archodex/archodex-agent) is
    licensed under the
    [GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).

## Fair Source Licensing

The [Fair Core License – MIT (FCL‑1.0‑MIT)](https://fcl.dev/) is part of the emerging [Fair Source](https://fair.io/)
movement. Fair Source licenses strike a balance between providing as much freedom as possible for users while protecting
our ability to sustain the project long-term for ongoing improvements.

Under the Fair Core License, you can:

- **Inspect our codebase**, including our registry of detection rules.
- **Use, modify, and self‑host Archodex** for your personal or organizational use, including in production.
- **Fork and redistribute** the software for yourself and for others.
- **Use our patented technologies** that we have invested research and development into for Archodex.

To ensure we are able to sustain ongoing research and development of Archodex the license prohibits you from:

- Redistributing Archodex source code in a **competing product or service**.
- Bypassing or disabling the **license key enforcement** that governs usage limits.

After two years, each release of Archodex software may also be used, modified, and redistributed under the
**[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)**. The MIT license is an
[Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org/) approved Open Source license.

## Patents

Archodex software is also protected by patent technology. Unlike copyright licenses, which determine how you can re-use
and redistribute the _exact source code_ you are using, patents cover _concepts and techniques_ that are implemented by
the software. Through the Fair Core License we provide you a **patent grant** that allows you to use our patent concepts
and techniques in Archodex software, again with prohibitions on:

- Redistributing Archodex source code in a **competing product or service**.
- Bypassing or disabling the **license key enforcement** that governs usage limits.

<aside>
  **Note:** The following is a brief description of patents and how they relate to Archodex source code. It is meant to
  be illustrative, but is not legally binding advice. If you have questions you may reach out to us at
  support@archodex.com and we will try our best to answer them. However, for legal advice you should always consult a
  qualified attorney.
</aside>

As stated in the [Fair Source Licensing](#fair-source-licensing) section above, after two years each release of software
may be used, modified, and redistributed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The MIT license
does **not** include a patent grant. This means that after two years of each release of Archodex software you can re-use
and redistribute pieces of the Archodex code, but you cannot re-use or redistribute the entire software under the MIT
license alone because it would implement our patent concepts and techniques.

For example, the Archodex Agent is covered by
[patent technology that orchestrates the eBPF programs](https://github.com/Archodex/archodex-agent/blob/main/patents)
that monitor encrypted network traffic. But pieces of the code can still be re-used after two years under the terms of
the MIT license. You could re-use the Archodex Agent's
[Golang PC Line Table parser code](https://github.com/Archodex/archodex-agent/blob/main/src/gopclntab.rs) in another
project under the MIT license, as long as that other project does not re-implement the orchestration of eBPF probes as
claimed in our patents.

To summarize, after two years from each release of Archodex software you may choose either of the following paths for
re-use:

1. Continue using Archodex under the original Fair Core License (with its patent grant).
2. Use any parts of the code under the terms of the MIT license as long as the resulting software does not reimplement
   our patent concepts and techniques.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We require contributions to our codebases to be made under the [Archodex Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](/cla). The
use of a CLA is common among Open Source / Fair Source software projects. The Archodex CLA ensures that we can continue
to make future Archodex releases by protecting against changes in copyright ownership for past contributions, among
other concerns. The first time you open a GitHub Pull Request against an Archodex repository we will ask you to accept
our CLA.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details id="is-archodex-open-source">
  <summary>Is Archodex open source?</summary>

No, Archodex is not open source. There is a widely agreed upon definition for Open Source maintained by the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI). We respect and value the Open Source cause, but we have chosen
a different path to achieve our goals of impact, transparency, and sustainability.

However, after two years following each release of Archodex software, the source code may be used, modified, and
redistributed under the terms of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which is an OSI-approved Open
Source license. Note, however, that this does not include a grant to use Archodex patent technology. Please see further
details above and below about patent rights.

<details>
  <summary>Can I use Archodex for personal projects?</summary>

Yes, you can use Archodex for personal projects! The Fair Core License allows individuals to use, modify, and self‑host
Archodex for personal use, including in production workloads.

Our only requirement is that you do not modify the license key protections. However, our intention is to make Archodex
free for individuals and small teams, so if you do hit usage limits on the free-tier for personal projects, then please
reach out to us at support@archodex.com.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use Archodex at work?</summary>

Yes, you can use Archodex at work! The license explicitly allows individuals and companies to use, modify, and self‑host
Archodex for their own internal projects, including production workloads. Our only requirement is that you do not modify
the license key protections.

Our intention is that most small organizations of one to two teams of software engineers are able to use Archodex for
free without hitting usage limits. If you do hit usage limits on the free-tier with reasonable "small teams" workloads,
then please reach out to us at support@archodex.com. We would be happy to discuss your usage and figure out whether our
limits need adjustment or whether you should consider a paid plan.

For larger organizations, once you exceed free-tier usage limits we request that you sign up for a paid plan to help
support Archodex’s continued development and maintenance.
