# Archodex.com website source code

The archodex.com website is a static site forked from the [AstroWind template](https://github.com/arthelokyo/astrowind).
It is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The static assets are
hosted from a CDN.

## Development

The website can be run in development mode using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

There is a Visual Studio Code task named `Astro dev server` that can also be used to start the server.
